# AI_exp

This repository contains a collection of classic Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and reasoning systems implemented in Python and Prolog.

## Features

- **Search algorithms:**  
  - A* (`a_star.py`)  
  - Breadth-First Search (`bfs.py`)  
  - Depth-First Search (`dfs.py`)  
  - Hill Climbing (`hill_climb.py`)
- **Puzzle solver:**  
  - 8-Puzzle (`eight_puzzle.py`)
- **Reasoning systems in Prolog:**  
  - Bayesian reasoning (`bayesian_reasoning.pl`)  
  - Forward chaining (`forward_chain_reasoning.pl`)  
  - Medical diagnosis expert system (`medical_diagnosis.pl`)  
  - Tic-Tac-Toe game logic (`tic_tac_toe.pl`)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x for `.py` files
- SWI-Prolog or similar for `.pl` files

### Running Python Scripts

python a_star.py
python bfs.py
python dfs.py
python hill_climb.py
python eight_puzzle.py



### Running Prolog Files

Open your terminal and run:

swipl bayesian_reasoning.pl
swipl forward_chain_reasoning.pl
swipl medical_diagnosis.pl
swipl tic_tac_toe.pl
